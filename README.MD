## About 

The goal of our project is to create a software that can perform mutation testing of a Smart Contract. First it creates AST - Mutation Testing tree. Then we kill mutants that have compliation errors and on the rest of them we perform testing using input.
The project is in development state. For now it produces AST tree with basic operators.

#### Input

- Ethereum Smart Contract
- n Tests

#### Output

- Mutation Testing result in %
